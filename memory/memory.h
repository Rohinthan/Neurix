/* ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * memory.h — unified memory interface (static OR dynamic backend)
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * One switch, two backends, one API. Callers only ever see
 * neuralc_alloc()/neuralc_free(); which backend services the call is
 * decided entirely inside memory.c by USE_STATIC_MEMORY.
 *
 *   USE_STATIC_MEMORY 1  — STATIC backend (embedded systems)
 *     Every byte comes out of one fixed global array,
 *     `memory_pool[MAX_MEMORY_POOL]`, via a linear (bump) allocator:
 *     an `offset` that only ever moves forward. No malloc/free, no
 *     fragmentation handling, no free-list — by design. Overflow
 *     (request would exceed MAX_MEMORY_POOL) is checked on every
 *     call and refused by returning NULL, never by corrupting
 *     adjacent memory.
 *     neuralc_free() is a documented no-op in this mode: a linear
 *     allocator cannot reclaim one block out of the middle of the
 *     pool without fragmentation bookkeeping, which is explicitly
 *     out of scope here. The *only* way to reclaim static-mode
 *     memory is neuralc_memory_reset(), which rewinds `offset` to 0
 *     for the whole pool at once.
 *
 *   USE_STATIC_MEMORY 0  — DYNAMIC backend (desktop systems)
 *     Plain malloc()/free(), with a running byte counter so
 *     neuralc_memory_used() and MEMORY_DEBUG logging work uniformly
 *     across both backends. neuralc_free() here really does free the
 *     block and decrements the counter.
 *
 * ── enabling static mode ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *     #define USE_STATIC_MEMORY 1
 *     #define MAX_MEMORY_POOL   (1024 * 1024)   // bytes, tune per target
 *     #include "memory.h"
 *
 *   -- or on the compile line --
 *     gcc -DUSE_STATIC_MEMORY=1 -DMAX_MEMORY_POOL=1048576 ...
 *
 * Leaving USE_STATIC_MEMORY undefined (default 0) gives ordinary
 * malloc/free behavior with no fixed limit.
