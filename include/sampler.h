 * Sampler value — see sampler.c) is used for TEMPERATURE/TOP_K/TOP_P,
 * NOT the global rand()/srand(), so sampling is reproducible and
 * thread-safe across independent Sampler instances.
 *
 * `s` is non-const because TEMPERATURE/TOP_K/TOP_P advance s->rng_state
 * in place (GREEDY never touches it — deterministic by construction).
 *
 * Returns the sampled index in [0, vocab_size), or -1 if `s` is
 * malformed (e.g. top_k <= 0, top_p outside (0,1], temperature <= 0
 * for a kind that requires it) or vocab_size <= 0.
